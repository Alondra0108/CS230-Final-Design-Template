# CS 230 Final Project – Software Design Document

## Project: The Gaming Room

This repository contains the final software design document for **The Gaming Room**, a fictional client seeking to expand their multiplayer drawing game, *Draw It or Lose It*, beyond Android to a wide range of platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and web-based systems. The software design outlines requirements for scalability, cross-platform compatibility, account and team management, and efficient performance for real-time gameplay.

The design process involved gathering client requirements, evaluating multiple operating platforms, identifying design constraints, proposing a scalable architecture, and organizing system components using UML modeling and domain diagrams. The final product is a complete and professional design document intended to guide a development team through building a functioning version of the game.

## Portfolio Reflection

This project helped me grow significantly in both design thinking and technical communication. I feel I did a good job maintaining organization throughout the document and clearly explaining the reasoning behind my design choices. For instance, when recommending Linux for the server platform, I not only mentioned that it was lightweight and secure, but also supported that claim by explaining how it enables cost savings and containerization with tools like Docker. I kept the client’s business goals in mind while writing, and I worked to ensure every section of the document had a purpose.

Working through the software design before writing any code was incredibly helpful. It gave me a clear mental roadmap of how each component would work together and helped me identify potential issues early on. When I worked on the domain model, for example, I could already see how class relationships would affect game logic and user interaction. This kind of planning made the development process far less overwhelming and more strategic.

If I were to revise any part of the document, I would expand on the domain model and include more specific methods and attributes for each class. I think adding more detail there, along with user interaction diagrams, would give an even clearer picture of how the app should function. I also see value in adding more visual elements, like wireframes or flowcharts, to illustrate user flow and data handling.

Throughout the project, I made sure to interpret the user's needs by putting myself in the player’s shoes. I thought about how they would interact with the app, how fast it needed to be, and how simple it should feel. That perspective influenced my decisions about system performance, responsiveness, and team management features. Understanding user needs is critical because software that's hard to use or confusing will likely be abandoned. When a system is intuitive, users are more likely to enjoy it and return.

My approach to software design was methodical and structured. I followed the template closely, which helped me break the project down into stages: gathering requirements, defining constraints, evaluating options, and creating a design that aligned with the client’s goals. Moving forward, I would continue using this kind of phased process, but I'd also include more user feedback and test ideas early through wireframes or rapid prototypes. This experience has taught me that good software starts long before the first line of code is written.
